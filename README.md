## 📚 Contents

This repository includes:

- ✅ **Tokenization** – Word and sentence tokenization using NLTK and spaCy  
- ✅ **Stemming & Lemmatization** – Text normalization techniques for preprocessing  
- ✅ **Stopword Removal** – Filtering common words using multiple approaches  
- ✅ **POS Tagging** – Part-of-speech tagging using spaCy and NLTK  
- ✅ **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** – Extracting entities like names, places, etc.  
- ✅ **Text Classification** – Basic sentiment and document classification tasks  
- ✅ **Bag of Words & TF-IDF** – Feature extraction techniques for text data  
- ✅ **Word Embeddings** – Introduction to Word2Vec and GloVe

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. Recommended version: `Python 3.10`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Punit231/NLP.git
cd NLP
```

2. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` is not present, manually install:

```bash
pip install nltk spacy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn pandas
```

3. Download NLTK data (first time only):

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('all')
```

4. Download spaCy model:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
